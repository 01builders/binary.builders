Today, we introduce ourselves to the world. At our core, we are builders, that bridge between vision and reality. We push the boundaries of technology with a blend of expertise and enthusiasm. Our mission is to create products that bring the industry forward. As leaders, we are dedicated to excellence, driven by passion and enthusiasm to shape the future of crypto and beyond.

We help teams build, grow, and operate. Executed with love and care.

## Build. Grow. Operate.

## Build
This is where ideas meets relentless execution. As the core developers of the Cosmos SDK, we ensure that hundreds of crypto applications operate securely and efficiently. Our team focuses on continuous improvement and innovation, driving the entire ecosystem forward. We support a diverse range of solutions, adapting beyond any single framework to meet the evolving needs of the industry.

##Grow
We nurture the best founders and teams. With mentorship from seasoned builders, lectures by industry experts, and access to a strong founder network, we offer comprehensive support. This includes software development, business strategy, marketing, go-to-market strategies, and governance, enabling our partners to succeed on all fronts. Whether it’s access to our builders program or individual consultations, we offer a wide range of services.

We’re not a VC, yet we invest in builders. We supports innovative projects that align with our mission. Its more than just financial backing; its an alliance on eye level to grow together.

## Operate
We run the software we build and are the backbone of many networks and protocols. Our infrastructure services include validators, nodes, RPC, data indexers and more. These services are crucial for building reliable, secure, and high-performing networks, ensuring robust support for projects of any scale.

## The Team
Our team fueled by research and engineering, turns complex problems into stable infrastructure and enjoyable user experiences. We value exploration, impact, and reliable systems. We love learning, clear communication, being thorough, and having fun. Operating fully remotely, our team spans Europe and beyond, forming a vibrant mix of cultures, perspectives, and expertise.

Onur and Marko set this journey in motion in 2022. Together we foster a culture that is both technology-driven and people-focused, ensuring our solutions are not only pioneering but also universally enjoyable and accessible.

## Grow the pie
We are believers in “growing the pie.” By having a collaborative environment, we unlock new possibilities and increase the overall value within the ecosystem. This approach not only helps develop cutting-edge solutions but also creates a more equitable industry landscape.

Through initiatives that promote technological advancement and community engagement, we contribute to a thriving crypto environment where new teams can emerge, and established entities can innovate. This ensures that the benefits of crypto are accessible to all.

As technology becomes increasingly essential to the digital economy, we anticipate a future rich with opportunities. This evolution will spawn new projects and level the playing field, fostering a thriving ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders — users, developers, enterprises, networks, and protocols alike.

## Moving forward
We’re excited for what lies ahead — many opportunities in an expansive and inclusive landscape. Here’s to forging ahead with more groundbreaking projects and shaping a future where the limits are defined only by our collective imagination.

Join us on this exciting journey, as we build the next generation of products with passion, excellence, and fun.
