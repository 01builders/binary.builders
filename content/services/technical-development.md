  ## What We Do Best

  ### Protocol Development
  Our experience in building protocols across various ecosystems allows us to make informed decisions about the best technologies to use for your project.

  ### Building
  Custom solutions tailored to your specific use case and requirements. We have a vast understanding of various technologies (Rust, Go, JS, Solidity, Move, Solana, etc..) and blockchain development (Rollups, L1s, smart contracts) allowing us to make informed decisions based off a products requirements.

  ### Smart Contracts
  Secure, efficient smart contracts across CosmWasm, EVM, and Solana ecosystems. Our engineers develop and audit contract systems with a focus on security, gas optimization, and seamless integration with bridges for cross-chain communication and existing blockchain infrastructure.

  ### Infrastructure
  Reliable validator services and infrastructure management for blockchain networks. We provide robust node operation for chains, monitoring solutions, and DevOps expertise to ensure your infrastructure remains secure and performant.

  ### Cosmos
  Through our experience in maintaining and being the core maintainer of the Cosmos SDK, our extensive work on IBC and deep understanding of CometBFT and Cosmwasm, we are able to provide a wide range of services to the Cosmos ecosystem.

  Binary Builders is home to some of the top contributors to [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/graphs/contributors) and [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/graphs/contributors).
