After being at the center of it all for so long I wanted a change of scenery and pace. Cosmos has slowed down and innovation, while still present, is not in the areas I see the future of blockchain going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I joined for the early vision of Cosmos, one where applications limited in throughput and computation (due to a VM) could build their own chain and define their own constraints. Application developers then began building sovereign chains because there was a premium when raising money for building L1s. This has led to a proliferation of chains launching without market validation. There were countless chains launched with high inflation that ended up robbing the token holders of value since the product was not yet figured out.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
